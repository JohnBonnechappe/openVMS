                     Johno's Easy Guide to LSE
                    ---------------------------

  LSE (language sensitive editor) is a text editor that is available on
VAX/VMS. This document is a summary of the salient points of LSE.
    
  This guide is written for someone who is familiar with screen editors, but has
had no experience with LSE.

LSE uses function keys and a command line to effect changes.

The following symbols are used :

  1) The keys F1 thru F20 are the grey keys along the top edge of the keyboard.

  2) The keys PF1 thru PF4 are located at the top of the numeric keypad. 

  3) N indicates a key on the numeric keypad. eg N1 is the 1 key on the numeric 
     keypad.

  4) G indicates the gold key viz PF1 on the numeric keypad. eg GN1 is entered
     by pressing both PF1 and 1 on the numeric keypad.

  5) cont indicates the control key. eg cont A means press the control key and A
     at the same time.

Invoking
---------
  LSE is invoked by typing in LSE FILENAME at the VMS command prompt. If the 
file name is omitted then the last session of LSE is continued. When reinvoking
LSE, the setup parameters from the previous session such as text marks are lost.

Leaving LSE
------------
  To leave LSE, move the cursor to the command line by pressing the Do key and
then type in either EXIT or QUIT. If you type in EXIT, the file that you created
or changed is saved. If you type in QUIT, no new file is saved.

Saving changes
--------------
  To save changes and continue editing, press the Do key then enter WRI.

Effect of LSE
--------------
When a file is edited with LSE, the original file stays unchanged. A new version
of the file contains the modifications that were done in LSE.

Command line
-------------
  To get to the command line, just press the Do key. Pressing the Do key again
returns the cursor to the text.

Scrolling
----------
  The text on the screen automatically scrolls when the cursor gets near either
the top or bottom of the screen.

Help
-----
  To see the help text, either :

      1) press the Do key then type in HELP. This shows you all commands you
         can enter on the command line.
      2) press the help key which is located just to the left of the Do key.
         This shows you what all the numeric key pad keys do and what control
         keys are available.

--------------------
  The find and substitute functions operate either in forward (after the cursor)
or in reverse (before the cursor). These directions are selected by pressing :
      1) N4 for forward
      2) N5 for reverse

Finding text
-------------
  To locate a text string first set the direction of the search, then either
press the Find key or press G PF3. You will be prompted for the text to locate.

Substituting one text string for another
-----------------------------------------

next text strings.

.                                 P3                                    15-05-91

Double window on a document
----------------------------
  You can have two windows on the screen (one above the other). To toggle 
between one and two windows press G= . To move the cursor between documents
press either G up arrow or G down arrow.

  Once you have set up a double screen you can edit any file in either window by
moving the cursor to the required window and then:
      1) Press the Do key
      2) Type in GOTO FILE FILENAME  where the FILENAME is the file to edit

Marking a block of text
------------------------
  Mark the text by moving the cursor to the top of the text and pressing
G. , then move the cursor to the end of the text. Text is marked as you move the
cursor.
 
  If you change your mind and dont want to mark the text after all, press GN. .

Moving a block of text
-----------------------
  Mark some text to move and press N6. The text is now removed from the document
and stored in a buffer. The text can now be copied from the buffer to any
part of the document by moving the cursor to the appropriate point and
pressing either the insert-here key or GN6.
 
Going directly to a line in a document
---------------------------------------
If you know the line number to go to in a document then do the following:
    1)  go to the top of the document by pressing G5
    2)  Press the gold key (PF1)
    3)  enter the line number
    4)  press the down arrow 

Similarly you can advance or regress through the document by omitting step 1
and pressing either the up or down arrow.


Inserting special characters
-----------------------------
To insert special characters :
    1) GN3
    2) enter the number eg 27 for  an escape
    3) press return

    eg esc   GN3 27 ret

Inserting a form feed
----------------------
This inserts a page break for printing purposes
cont L

Alter Size of Scrolling region
-------------------------------
    This sets the number of lines at top and bottom of screen where placement of
    the cursor causes scrolling.
    SET SCROLL t b     !sets t lines at top and b lines at bottom
    SET SCROLL 0 0     !effectively turns off scrolling
.                                 P4                                    15-05-91

Macros
-------
  A macro may be set up by using either the define command utility or the
define key utility. For example to create a macro to move a block of text into
the paste buffer without cutting the text from the document enter the
following :
    1) press the Do key
    2) enter DEFINE COMMAND COP "DO CUT,PASTE"

  This has now created a command called COP which does a CUT and PASTE.

  Then whenever you mark some text you only need to enter COP on the command 
line to move the marked text into the $PASTE buffer. The text may then be copied
anywhere else by moving to the desired place and pressing the insert-here key.
    

Defining a new Key Function
----------------------------
  A command may be linked to a key as follows :
    1) press the Do key
    2) enter DEFINE KEY
    3) press the key to be defined
       ( eg gold c would be entered as C/IF_STATE=GOLD )
    4) enter the command to link to the key (eg "DO CUT,PASTE")

Saving your Macros  
-------------------
    1) Put the macros into a text file
       (eg DEFINE COMMAND COP "DO CUT,PASTE" )
    2) Save the text file
    3) When you invoke LSE use the qualifier /INITIALIZATION=filespec

To see tabs in a file
---------------------
    This causes all TABS in a file to display as "HT...."
    1) SET MODE TAB=VISIBLE

Saving your Tokens and templates (ignore this for now)                 
-------------------------------------------------------                     
  Save any you create by entering :
    SAVE ENVIRONMENT FILESPEC

  Subsequent ones can be saved in the same file by entering :
    SAVE ENVIRONMENT/NEW FILESPEC

Where the FILESPEC is a spec for a file to contain them

Then whenever you invoke LSE use LSE/ENVIRONMENT=FILESPEC










.                                 P5                                    15-05-91

Copying text between existing files
------------------------------------
    1) Set up the two files in two windows on the screen.
    2) Set up the Macro COP.
    3) Mark the text to be copied
    4) Type COP at the command line.
    5) Move the cursor to the other window by pressing G and up or down arrow.
    6) Move the cursor to the point where the text is to be copied to.
    7) Press the Insert-here key or go to the command line and enter PASTE.

    CUT/NOERASE may be used instead of the COP macro

Copy a part of a file to a new file
------------------------------------
 1) Mark the text to copy
 2) goto the command line and enter DO,CUT,PASTE
 3) goto the command line and enter GOTO FILE tmpfile/CREATE
 4) press the Insert Here key


Change of case
---------------
 To change the case press GN1. Only one character is changed.
 To change the case of 20 characters press G then 20 then GN1.


Move Cursor to start of line
-----------------------------
 There are three ways to do this

 method a   GOTO LINE/BEGINNING/REVERSE
 method b   GOTO LINE/REVERSE/BOUND
 method c   cont H

Move Cursor to end of line
---------------------------
 GOTO LINE/FORW/END   !go to end of current line, if at end go end of next line
 GOTO LINE/FORW/BOUND !go to end of current line regardless

Look at function key settings
------------------------------
 SHOW KEY


Move text sideways
------------------
 1) Mark the text using select
 2) Press G left arraw or G right arrow


Programming template
--------------------
 Enter the verb or part of a verb then press cont E.

 Eg.  PERF then press cont E

 All the possible expansions for PERFORM are then displayed. Pressing cont E
 expands the PERFORM subclauses.
