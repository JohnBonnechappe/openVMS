# Here are some useful reads for openVMS

Note that some of these are docs so they will need to be opened as binary.

These are all documents that I either wrote myself or picked up from somewheres unknown. None of the docs here show any evidence of copyright so use with discretion if unsure.

ðŸ˜ŠHappy reading!
