openVMS programs and utilities

Some openVMS programs utilities and documentataion that I have written over the years

👀 EZITRAK this is a utility to log support issues in an Rdb database using DEFFORMS for data entry. This was written when I was in production support when we had no app for keeping track of issues. Coding is done in COBOL. Database access is through Modular SQL.
This is probably a good little project for someone seeking to learn COBOL/SQL/DEFORMS in an openVMS environment.

DCL_menu_system is an automatic menu/form utility for DCL

EZITRAK folder contains the original test version

EZINEW folder contains the "production" version Written circa 1992.

PetroLink_Notes are some notes on the now retired BP PetroLink system

RDB are some SQL routines for working with RDB
